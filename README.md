# Arduino-Smart-Door-Alarm
Arduino project developed with Ardunio Nano RP2040 Board that consists of a voice-activated smart door alarm. The alarm connects to Wi-Fi and sends messages using the MQTT protocol. For the automations I used Node-Red. There is also support for other MQTT clients integration to remotely activate/ deactivate the alarm.
